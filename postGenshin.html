          <p>
                For those of you who haven't heard, Genshin Impact is a free to play (albeit Gacha) open-world action RPG 
                that launched on the 28th of September 2020, and in just four days after its launch, the game already
                hit 17 million downloads, making it one of the most successful video game launches in recent years. Though I 
                am not a part of those 17 million who got the game in the first four days, I have to say that I really love the game
                and can't imagine how empty my quarantine life would be without it. I have spent a lot of time (and some money) on 
                Genshin Impact and enjoyed every second of it that I went and thought <stong>"Why not make a blog post about it?"</stong>.
                So here I am writing about my top 4 five-star characters in the game. Five-star characters are the rarest characters 
                in the game, since it takes 90 wishes to guaranteethat you get one. Getting 90 wishes takes <strong>a lot</strong> of 
                time and <strong>a lot</strong> of work, and that's why I only have 4 of them at the moment.
          </p>
          
          <h1>1. Zhongli</h1>

          <img class="genshinimgs" src="Screenshot (61).png" alt="Zhongli">
          
          <p> 
                I really like support burst characters like Zhongli. He is so dependable with his shield but still hits hard with his burst, making him
                a vital part in any team composition due to his versatility. 
          </p>

          <h1>2. Keqing</h1>

          <img class="genshinimgs" src="Screenshot (62).png" alt="Zhongli">

          <p> 
                Being an electro DPS, I like how fast she attacks and how her overall playstyle is about speed. 
                Her teleport skill really is useful in roaming and doing a lot of aerial attacks, not to mention
                making her a very hard target to hit. If you love speedy characters, then consider rolling for her 
                banner if you are in need of a main DPS character.
          </p>

          <h1>3. Hu Tao</h1>

          <img class="genshinimgs" src="Screenshot (63).png" alt="Zhongli">

          <p> 
                She is one of the strongest characters I have at the moment, due to her high crit rate after using her elemental skill 
                and high pyro damage when her health is below 50%. I also like her for reasons other than her combat abilities, 
                in particular her personality. Hu Tao as a character is fun and quirky so its always fun to play her. 
          </p>

          <h1>4. Venti</h1>

          <img class="genshinimgs" src="Screenshot (64).png" alt="Zhongli">

          <p> 
                Venti is the best when it comes to crowd control, especially when you're dealing with the spiral abyss, mainly due to
                his elemental burst, which basically creates an inescapable black hole that deals a lot of damage. In addition, I like how 
                you can fly with his skill, making exploration a lot easier. His personality is a bit annoying due to his care-free nature, 
                but his skills are dependable. 
          </p>
